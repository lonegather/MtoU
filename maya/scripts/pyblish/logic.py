    The test determines whether or not to proceed from one
    plug-in to the next. The `vars` are updated everytime
    a plug-in is about to be processed with information about
    the upcoming plug-in.

    Returning any value means failure, whereas 0, False and None
    represents success. Similar to return/exit codes. You can provide
    a message along with a failure, such as specifying why the test
    failed. The message can then be used by process handlers,
    such as a GUI.

    You can provide your own test by registering it, see example below.
